## Subject :
After 2 years of intense research and development, the young French start-up NOSE has succeeded in developing an innovative process for the detection and analysis of fine particles in the air. According to the arguments put forward by its creators, the NOSE technology will make it possible to manufacture air quality monitoring devices at a very low cost, which will enable this technology to be deployed on a very large scale. NOSE’s stated objective is to massively deploy these devices on the territories of the euro zone in order to help the authorities in the fight against air pollution and the prevention of health risks. Supported in its development by a program backed by Europe, the NOSE start-up now has 5 years’ visibility to disseminate its technology in European countries. Today, NOSE is engaged in a crucial stage of its development, focusing all its efforts on the development of its AQM (Air Quality Monitoring) device.
 
 
##  Problem 

How to design and produce a given project?

##  Achievements 

First, to make sure we understood the customer’s needs, we performed a functional analysis of the requirement. We were then able to design the case in 3D using Fusion 360 software.

This allowed us to make plans of the box.

Then, we made a mapping of the manufacturing process which allowed us to deduce a schedule.

Then, we performed different analyses:
* Analysis of measurement data
* Financial forecasts
* Areas of improvement


## Acquired skills :

This project brought me 3D modeling skills, but above all project management skills, from its conception to its eventual marketing.
