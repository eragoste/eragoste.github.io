## Subject :
The enormous potential associated with medical data has led the healthcare industry to a significant and rapid transformation. As a result, the requirements for implementing improvements are becoming more and more significant. To move forward in the right direction, practitioners (physicians, nurses) and facility administrators need direct access to actionable information in medical data to improve performance and quality of care in measurable ways. The demand for actionable information from integrated medical data is growing. There is significant untapped information in patient flow, medical records, service tracking, cycle times, and facility profitability data waiting to be discovered.

 
##  Problem 

How to make medical data usable?


##  Achievements 

Here is a brief description of the data sources made available:
* A PostgreSQL DB which manages the medical and administrative care of patients
* A database exported in csv on the management of hospitals in France
* Flat files on satisfaction notes issued by patients on different health institutions
* As well as files that expose the directory of deaths in France

With this data, we had to propose a complete solution in terms of models, tools and architecture that would allow us to extract and store the data, and then explore and visualize it according to different criteria. First, we had to create a solution for integrating data from distributed files into a single persistent source using Talend. Then, we identified the needs of the users (practitioners, head of establishment) in terms of data analysis for direct exploitation on the follow-up of the patients at the national level and in the long term Finally, we made recommendations in terms of integration tools, storage, and adapted visualization software as well as secure data mining to promote better decision making.



## Acquired skills :

During this project I was able to learn how to use Talend software, but also Power Bi.
